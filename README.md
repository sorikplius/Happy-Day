## Hello
  
  
  #About the project
This project was created by me, using tutorial Udemy using engine Godot. It’s a 2D Platformer, all assets are commercial-free for education (provided by the tutorial + some custom ones I added).

#Game idea 
You’re a happy bunny, running fast, jumping high, avoiding the enemy, and collecting coins. 

#My own addition outside the tutorial:
- I added ability to pick bunny gender (playing character) and a start screen
- Transition of the score and lives between the played levels

#How to play / run the game
Check-out the release section #[Game Releases](https://github.com/sorikplius/Happy-Day/releases) - there are Windows, Mac and Linux versions available.
