## Hello
  
  
  This project was created by me using tutorial [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) using engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
  Here is 2D Platformer all assets are commercial-free for education.
  
  Game idea speed, high jump, avoid enemy, collect coins. My extension provides the score for the next scene this was done outside of the tutorial
  and I add more scenes for pick bunny gender
